There are a couple of new features for the TodoList class:

The first and most important change is that the TodoList class now works with an hash which can consist out of multiple lists
This also includes sometimes major changes in the existing methods.

To name some new methods:

.to_file: this method creates a text file from the current list
.load_from_file: this method can load a file and adds it to the lists
.delete_list: self explanatory
.change_list_to: change to a given list
.add_list: self explanatory
